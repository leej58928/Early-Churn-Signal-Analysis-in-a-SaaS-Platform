# Early-Churn-Signal-Analysis-in-a-SaaS-Platform
This project analyzes customer behavior in a fictional multi-table SaaS dataset to identify signals associated with early churn versus long-term retention.  The analysis emphasizes interpretable early signals and translates them into a practical risk prioritization framework that can support real-world retention decisions.
